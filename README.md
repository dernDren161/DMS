# DMS
Disease Monitoring System(DMS) is a software that allows college/hostel authorities to keep track of the number of students suffering from mosquito-borne diseases on a yearly basis.

<b>Motivation for the Project:</b>
Yearly thousands of people from tropical countries like India suffer from mosquito-borne diseases like dengue, malaria, chikungunya, etc. and such diseases even kill a significant mass of infectants also. Even worse, such situations spread like wildfire in Indian University hostels where it takes no time for the virus to decipher into an epidemic.
On top of this conundrum, most college authorities do not have any information regarding the number of students infected on a yearly basis. If the culture of saving information about the number of students affected by such diseases is kept digitally then it can surely help to tackle the situtaion in the coming years.
Also the data generated from such systems could be analysed in Big Data clusters like <b>Hadoop</b> to analyse the spreading nature of such viruses.
For Example: Hostel Authorities can know which hostel tolls for the highest number of infectants and compare that across different parameters like "hostel hygiene", "volume of water bodies around the hostel", etc. This simply helps tackle the problem more scientifically.

<b>About the Software:</b>
DMS is written in Java availing from Swing GUI. It uses MYSQL for data storage.

<b>Functions:</b>
- Serialization of data into external files.
- Effective use of mnemonics and accelerators.
- Tabular storage of information w.r.t the date of insertion.


<b>Software Check:</b>
- In case of difficulty to connect to MYSQL, please install the `jdbc` driver and put it in the project classpath.

<b>FootNote:</b> Please do not shy out to commit for the improvement of the software.
